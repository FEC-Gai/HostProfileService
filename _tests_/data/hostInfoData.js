    "host_about": "I'm a designer that gets inspiration from my travel and all the people I meet along the way!!! I love gardening, snuggling with my pups, and sharing a meal with friends and family. San Francisco is the place I call home and I hope to share everything this great city has to offer to my guests.",
    "host_messages": "No smoking in the house Not suitable for pets - We have cats No parties or events Check-in is after 4 PM. I can't guarantee the room will be ready until about 4 PM. If you need to drop off bags before heading out to explore San Francisco... let me know and I can definitely help you out! Quiet time is from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM (talking and watching a movie on your computer is totally fine). The quiet time is more for us than you! We will, of course, try to be as mindful as possible but as I have a tween and a teen it isn't always easy to control the noise level in the morning on the way to school or at bedtime. Late arrivals are OK! Smoking is allowed outside in the yard or on the porch.",
